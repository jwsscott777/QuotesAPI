You must want to be different [and intend to be] before you can begin to change yourself. Then you must make your future dream a present fact. You do this by assuming the feeling of your wish fulfilled. By desiring to be other than what you are, you can create an ideal of the person you want to be and assume that you are already that person. If this assumption is persisted in until it becomes your dominant feeling, the attainment of your ideal is inevitable.",

The reason is simple. Pain is just a signal from your body, like a doorbell ringing, saying: please fix me. So if you never answer the door, the pain never goes away. The way out of pain is to go toward it. Answer the 'doorbell' and allow your body to resolve whatever was going on that caused the pain signal.",
